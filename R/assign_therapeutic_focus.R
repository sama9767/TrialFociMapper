#' @title  assign_therapeutic_focus
#'
#' @description
#' This function assigns a therapeutic focus to each clinical trial based on weights specified for
#' major mesh headings. The weights are determined based on a disease-centric approach, where higher
#' weights indicate higher prominence. This approach considers diseases as the primary factor in
#' determining the therapeutic focus, with secondary consideration given to the associated organ
#' systems, pathology, or symptoms.The function takes a data frame with NCT IDs and major mesh
#' headings as input and generates a single therapeutic focus for each trial.
#'
#' @param data A data frame containing NCT IDs and major mesh headings.
#' @param nctid_col The name of the column in the data frame that contains the NCT IDs.
#' @param mesh_heading_cols A character vector specifying the column names in the data frame that
#' contain the major mesh headings.
#'
#' @return A modified data frame with an additional column "therapeutic_focus" containing the assigned
#' therapeutic focus for each clinical trial.
